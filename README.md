## ðŸ˜Ž Coding style

We make use of **[Javascript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/)** while developing.

You can integrate it with [eslint](https://eslint.org/) linter tool in your IDE to help smoothen the process by integrating automatic linting in compile time.

We already have a `eslint.config.js` file in the root of the project which you can use to configure your IDE.

We also have husky hooks with prettier and eslint to make sure that the code is linted and formatted before committing.

If you want to read more about the rules, read [Coding style](docs/coding-style.md)
